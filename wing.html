<main>
    <p><strong>Computational thinking</strong> builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or a machine. Computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone.</p>

    <p>Computational thinking confronts the riddle of machine intelligence: <em>What can humans do better than computers?</em> and <em>What can computers do better than humans?</em> Most fundamentally, it addresses the question: <em>What is computable?</em></p>

    <p>Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists. To reading, writing, and arithmetic, we should add computational thinking to every child’s analytical ability. Just as the printing press facilitated the spread of the three Rs, computing facilitates the spread of computational thinking.</p>

    <p>Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science. It includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field.</p>

    <p>Having to solve a particular problem, we might ask: How difficult is it to solve? and What’s the best way to solve it? Computer science rests on solid theoretical underpinnings to answer such questions precisely.</p>

    <p>Computational thinking is thinking recursively. It is parallel processing. It is interpreting code as data and data as code. It is type checking as the generalization of dimensional analysis. It is recognizing both the virtues and the dangers of aliasing, or giving something more than one name. It is judging a program not just for correctness and efficiency but also for aesthetics, and a system’s design for simplicity and elegance.</p>

    <p>It is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task. It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem, using invariants to describe system behavior succinctly, and modularizing in anticipation of multiple users or future use.</p>

    <div class="highlight">“Computational thinking represents a universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer scientists, would be eager to learn and use.”</div>

    <p>Computational thinking is thinking in terms of prevention, protection, and recovery from worst-case scenarios through redundancy, damage containment, and error correction. It is heuristic reasoning, planning, learning, and scheduling in the presence of uncertainty. It is search, search, and more search.</p>

    <p>Everyday examples include: your daughter packing her backpack (prefetching and caching), retracing steps when something is lost (backtracking), and deciding when to buy instead of rent (online algorithms). Even choosing a supermarket line relates to performance modeling.</p>

    <h2>What It Is, and Isn’t</h2>
    <p>Computer science is the study of computation—what can be computed and how to compute it. Computational thinking thus has the following characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptualizing, not programming.</strong> Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundamental, not rote skill.</strong> Computational thinking is a skill every human must know to function in modern society.</li>
        <li><strong>A way humans, not computers, think.</strong> It is a way humans solve problems, not an attempt to make humans think like computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Complements mathematical and engineering thinking.</strong> It draws on both the rigor of mathematics and the practicality of engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Ideas, not artifacts.</strong> It’s not just software and hardware—it’s the concepts and approaches that matter.</li>
        <li><strong>For everyone, everywhere.</strong> Computational thinking will be a reality when it is so integral it disappears as an explicit philosophy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Computational thinking is a grand vision to guide computer science educators, researchers, and practitioners as we act to change society’s image of the field. We especially need to reach the pre-college audience—teachers, parents, and students.</p>
